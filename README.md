# Recipe Box

This program takes a recipe URL and scrapes the recipe, converts it to Markdown format and store it in a Zettelkasten.
I use the free [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Zettelkasten software and repurpose it as a electronic recipe box.

The user can edit the recipe, fix errors, make notes, rate it, add #tags and [[backlinks]] to organise his/her collection.

A recipe box can be a [treasure chest](https://www.ourstate.com/a-kitchens-riches/), but you have to put in some effort.
