# Recipe Box

This is a fork of [lcordier/recipe_box](https://github.com/lcordier/recipe_box) modified to
directly output files suitable for my Wiki.js instance.

## Installation
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/SinTan1729/recipe-box-for-wikijs
```

## Usage
```bash
recipe_box [options] <list-of-links>
```
Available options:
```bash
-l : List all available sites
-w : Enable wild mode. This tries to scrape from unsupported sites.
-v : More verbose output.
```

For more information, please take a look at the upstream.
